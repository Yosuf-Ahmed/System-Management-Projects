# 🛠️ System Management Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of system management projects built using **C++** and **C** as part of my journey to master:

- The Basic Programming Concepts Using C and C++
- File-based databases
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Clean Code & Modularity
- System Simulation & Design
- and more...

## 📌 Project Ideas & Purpose

These projects simulate real-world management systems to apply and reinforce programming concepts. Examples include:

- 🏥 **Hospital Management System** — Patient queue handling (urgent/regular)
- 📚 **Library System** — Lending, returning, cataloging books
- 🏫 **School System** — Student records and performance
- 📁 **File-based Database Systems** (planned)

Each project is structured to improve:
- ✅ Code organization
- ✅ Use of `structs`, `arrays`, and `functions`
- ✅ Step-by-step upgrades: from basic logic → to OOP & file handling

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project is in a dedicated folder containing:

- `main.cpp` — full implementation
- `README.md` — project-specific description (in progress)
- Future: `*.h` header files, `*.txt` database files, etc.

> Because learning is not just about syntax.  
> It's about building actual systems, managing data, thinking like an engineer.
